"""
An abstract database cursor implementation, conformant with PEP 249.

Because it is common for database connections to implement the execute
functionality of the cursor, returning a cursor containing the results,
this is implemented using a set of mixins:

 - AsyncCursorExecuteMixin
 - AsyncCursorFechMixin
 - CursorSetSizeMixin
